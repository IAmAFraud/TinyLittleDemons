# Tiny Little Demons
This is a project I completed as a team of 5 for a class. This game is a tangram-like game, set in the world of Ethshar. In this game, you are trying to complete the spells necessary to summon demons by filling in the shapes using the given components. There are around 10 levels, allowing you to get a sense of how the shapes can fit together and get you into the world.
